Description:

This Python script provides a function to perform prime factorization of an integer. The function takes an integer input and returns its prime factors along with their exponents in a list of tuples.

Functionality:

Input: An integer greater than 1.

Output: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a prime factor and its exponent.

How to Run:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Save the script in a .py file (e.g., prime_factorization.py).
Run the script using:

bash :
python prime_factorization.py

Example Usage:

python:
# Example of prime factorization
result = perform_prime_factorization_of_integer(60)
print(result)  # Output: [(2, 2), (3, 1), (5, 1)]

Requirements:
Python 3.x
